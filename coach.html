        <strong>Poonam Yadav</strong> – The name speaks for itself. The lady has
        been rocking the field of Transformational Yoga and Beauty. As a yoga
        health and wellness coach she has touched countless minds and souls in
        the past 15 long years and continues to inspire them to lead a healthy
        lifestyle. She tried her hands on social media and found instant success
        possibly due to the quality and genuinity of the content she creates and
        shares. Personally speaking, her content seems so legit and easy to
        relate to, and at the same time is inspiring.

        <strong>She is highly educated and is role model for the Youth.</strong
        ><br /><em>Sounds like a cakewalk, doesn’t it?</em> But sadly life is
        full of challenges and upheavals and journey of the unexpected.<br />Born
        in a loving family in Delhi, along with school and play she practised
        yoga as her mother was also into yoga and she was fascinated seeing her
        mom. She started practising yoga not as a profession but as a matter of
        fun. She got married to an Army Officer and the Olive Green life exposed
        her to vast and varied experiences. While the challenges and separation
        in the Army were demanding, it did come with pride. She was blessed with
        a baby and life as a sole mother did test her mettle and grit with the
        husband away on call of duty.

          >Mothers can probably relate to the physical and emotional trauma new
          mothers go through.</strong
        >
        At the same time life put forth her biggest test and moments of pain as
        her hero, her father was detected with last stage cancer and sadly left
        them to live another life. She was completely broken, empty,
        directionless and went under depression. Now that became the turning
        point which set forth embarked the journey of the Yogini. She started
        practising yoga at a spiritual level which helped her emerge out of
        depression and she herself became the guiding light for others. She
        became the International Grandmaster in Yoga and started helping and
        inspiring people to lead a healthy and happy life. She got associated
        with many NGOs and She began conducting workshops and help people get
        rid of anxiety and depression. To help more people and making her
        knowledge more accessible, she shares her knowledge on Youtube,
